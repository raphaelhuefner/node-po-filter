# po-filter

**po-filter** is a node.js module to apply arbitrary filters to po files.

See the description of the file format at the official gettext website:
http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/gettext.html#PO-Files

This module is loosely based on https://github.com/andris9/node-gettext ,
but with an event-based infrastructure.
